# Objective

Hybrid AI, which integrates symbolic and sub-symbolic methods, has emerged as a promising paradigm for advancing human-centric personalization. By combining machine learning with structured knowledge representations, hybrid AI enables interpretable and adaptive user models that account for complex human factors such as biases, mental models, and affective states. 
The HyPer workshop focuses on how hybrid AI approaches—combining neural architectures, symbolic representations, and cognitive/behavioral frameworks—can foster more explainable and personalized user experiences. Specifically, we aim to explore innovative applications of hybrid AI in personalization, bridging the gap between explainability, cognitive modeling, and automated adaptation to user preferences. The HyPer workshop will provide a venue for researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions in this interdisciplinary field.
